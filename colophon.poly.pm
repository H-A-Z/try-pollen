These pages are my playground for trying out ◊hyperlink["http://pollenpub.com"]{Pollen}, a system for publishing books on the web or anywhere else.

In particular, I’m trying to experiment with marrying web documents with printed books: generating high quality print-ready ◊smallcaps{PDF} files from the same markup used to create the web pages. The ◊hyperlink["http://www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/"]{Tufte ◊smallcaps{CSS}} project, and the ◊hyperlink["https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/"]{Tufte-LaTeX} project on which it is based, turned out to be the perfect tools for the job. On most pages (including this one!) you can click the ◊smallcaps{PDF} link to see the LaTeX-generated print version.

The Pollen source is available ◊hyperlink["https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen"]{on Github}.

I'm ◊hyperlink["http://twitter.com/joeld"]{on Twitter}. You can also find me at my ◊hyperlink["http://tilde.club/~joeld"]{tilde.club page} and my main site, ◊hyperlink["http://thelocalyarn.com"]{◊i{The Local Yarn}}, neither of which (yet) use Pollen.

Please excuse my freshman writing.
